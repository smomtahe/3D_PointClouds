# ECG Signal Processing and Machine Learning Classification

This repository contains code for processing electrocardiogram (ECG) signals and performing machine learning classification tasks using Python. It includes scripts for feature extraction, classification, and evaluation.

Features:
Wavelet Transform: Extract features from ECG signals using wavelet transform for both time and frequency domain analysis.
Fourier Transform: Additional feature extraction using Fourier transform to analyze frequency components of ECG signals.
FIR and IIR Filters: Apply Finite Impulse Response (FIR) and Infinite Impulse Response (IIR) filters for signal preprocessing.
Machine Learning Classification: Utilize machine learning algorithms such as Decision Trees, Random Forest, and AdaBoost for ECG signal classification.
