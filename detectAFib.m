function AFib = detectAFib(ECG_signal, Fs)
    % Function to detect atrial fibrillation (AFib) in an ECG signal.
    % Inputs:
    %   - ECG_signal: ECG signal data
    %   - Fs: Sampling frequency of the ECG signal
    % Output:
    %   - AFib: Binary value indicating presence (1) or absence (0) of AFib

    % Perform AFib detection algorithm here
    % Example algorithm:
    % Compute some feature(s) indicative of AFib
    % Apply threshold or classifier to determine AFib presence

    % For demonstration purposes, let's assume AFib is present if heart rate is irregular
    % You can replace this with a proper AFib detection algorithm
    
    % Calculate heart rate
    [~, RR_int] = findpeaks(ECG_signal, 'MinPeakHeight', 0.5, 'MinPeakDistance', Fs); % Assuming QRS complex detection has been done
    % findpeaks detects peaks in the ECG signal, which typically correspond to the QRS complex of the heartbeat. It calculates the R-R intervals, which are the time intervals between successive heartbeats.

    % Calculate average RR interval
    avg_RR_int = mean(diff(RR_int));

    % Set threshold for RR interval irregularity
    threshold_irregularity = 0.1; % Adjust as needed

    % Check if RR intervals are irregular
    irregularity = std(diff(RR_int)) / avg_RR_int;

    % If irregularity exceeds threshold, classify as AFib
    if irregularity > threshold_irregularity
        AFib = 1; % AFib detected
    else
        AFib = 0; % No AFib detected
    end
